=head1 NAME
 
McBain::WithWebSocket - Load a McBain API as a WebSocket server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# write your API as you normally would, and create
	# a simple server script:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w

	BEGIN { $ENV{MCBAIN_WITH} = 'WithWebSocket'; }

	use warnings;
	use strict;
	use MyAPI;

	MyAPI->start(80); # default port is 8080

	# if your API is object oriented
	MyAPI->new(%attrs)->start(80);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<McBain::WithWebSocket> turns your L<McBain> API into a L<WebSocket|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket>
server using L<Net::WebSocket::Server>.

The created server will be a JSON-in JSON-out service. When a client sends a message to
the server, it is expected to be a JSON string, which will be converted into a hash-ref
and serve as the payload for the API. The payload must have a C<path> key, which holds
the complete path of the route/method to invoke (for example, C<GET:/math/sum>). The
results from the API will be formatted into JSON as well and sent back to the client.

Note that if an API method does not return a hash-ref, this runner module will automatically
turn it into a hash-ref to ensure that conversion into JSON will be possible. The created
hash-ref will have one key - holding the method's name, with whatever was returned from the
method as its value. For example, if method C<GET:/divide> in topic C</math> returns an
integer (say 7), then the client will get the JSON C<{ "GET:/math/divide": 7 }>.

=head2 EXAMPLE CLIENT

I haven't succeeded in creating a Perl WebSocket client using any of the related modules on
CPAN. Documentation in this area seems to be extremely lacking. On the other hand, I created
a very simply client with NodeJS in about two minutes. If you need to test your C<McBain> API
running as a WebSocket server, and have a similar problem, take a look at the C<client.js>
file in the examples directory of this distribution.

=head2 SUPPORTED HTTP METHODS

This runner support all methods natively supported by L<McBain>. That is: C<GET>, C<PUT>,
C<POST>, C<DELETE> and C<OPTIONS>.

The C<OPTIONS> method is special. It returns a hash-ref of methods supported by a specific
route, including description and parameter definitions, if any. See L<McBain/"OPTIONS-REQUESTS">
for more information.

=head1 METHODS EXPORTED TO YOUR API

=head2 start( [ $port ] )

Starts the WebSocket server, listening on the supplied port. If C<$port> is not provided,
C<8080> is used by default.

=head1 METHODS REQUIRED BY MCBAIN

=head2 init( $target )

Creates and exports the L<start()|/"start( [ $port ] )"> method for your API's root package.

=cut

sub init {
	my ($class, $target) = @_;

	if ($target->is_root) {
		no strict 'refs';
		*{"${target}::start"} = sub {
			my ($pkg, $port) = @_;

			Net::WebSocket::Server->new(
				listen => $port || 8080,
				on_connect => sub {
					my ($serv, $conn) = @_;

					$conn->on(
						utf8 => sub {
							my ($conn, $payload) = @_;

							$conn->send_utf8($pkg->call($payload));
						}
					);
				}
			)->start;
		};
	}
}

=head2 generate_env( $req )

Receives the request JSON and creates C<McBain>'s standard env
hash-ref from it.

=cut

sub generate_env {
	my ($self, $payload) = @_;

	$payload = $json->decode($payload);

	confess { code => 400, error => "Namespace must match <METHOD>:<ROUTE> where METHOD is one of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE or OPTIONS" }
		unless $payload->{path} =~ m/^(GET|POST|PUT|DELETE|OPTIONS):[^:]+$/;

	my ($method, $route) = split(/:/, delete($payload->{path}));

	return {
		METHOD	=> $method,
		ROUTE		=> $route,
		PAYLOAD	=> $payload
	};
}

=head2 generate_res( $env, $res )

Converts the result from an API method in JSON. Read the discussion under
L</"DESCRIPTION"> for more info.

=cut

sub generate_res {
	my ($self, $env, $res) = @_;

	$res = { $env->{METHOD}.':'.$env->{ROUTE} => $res }
		unless ref $res eq 'HASH';

	return $json->encode($res);
}

=head2 handle_exception( $err )

Formats exceptions into JSON.

=cut

sub handle_exception {
	my ($class, $err) = @_;

	return $json->encode($err);
}

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
   
No configuration files are required. To tell L<McBain> to use this runner module,
the C<MCBAIN_WITH> environment variable must be set to C<WithWebSocket>. See the
L</"SYNOPSIS"> for an example.
